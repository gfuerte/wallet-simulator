# wallet-simulator
Simulates a wallet/budget spreadsheet allowing users to either create a spreadsheet from scratch or upload their own via txt file. This program provides a set of functions that allows users to input new data as well as different printing and sorting options. Based on the user input, this program can either (D)eposit transactions, (W)ithdraw transactions, (P)rint balance/income/expenses/all transactions/all deposits/all withdrawals, or (S)ort by default, category, newest, or oldest.

To use: 
Download this repo and run the User class in command line. 
Upon running the program, you will be guided on how to use it.
To upload your own spreadsheet, create a new txt and follow the format shown in example.txt or example2.txt.

Personal project with the intention of creating a memory of my lost wallet (now found!) as well as learning the pillars of OOP.
